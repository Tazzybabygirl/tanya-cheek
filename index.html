              <h2>Let's Talk About Me</h2>
                <p id="me">My name is Tanya Cheek. I am a new developer working on figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.
                Technology in general has always fascinated me and this website is the start of a new adventure into the world of development.
                 I enjoy helping other people achieve their dreams. I am organized, efficient and empathetic. I actively listen and have great attention to detail.
                  My alter ego is an accountant and in my leisure time I like to crochet gifts for other people.

              <p>This project was a chance to play with color backgrounds while learning the concepts of div and float.
                 I am a fan of color and find different ways to incorporate in my life.</p>

            <h3>Jubilee Austen</h3>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>This project allowed me to bring what I was learning together to create a one page portfolio style website similar to this website.
                 With step by step guidance, I was able to see the changes take place as I progressed. Starting with the HTML structure and completing the CSS styling
                allowed me to embrace the process and learn some key practices of development.</p>

                <p>Here I had a chance to learn photoshop and create a webpage based on a psd file. All structure and styling were done with no step by step instructions.
                  Copying something already designed is a good way to practice the basic concepts to build your skills.</p>
